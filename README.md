# JavaScript Projects Collection

Welcome to my **JavaScript Projects** repository!  
This repository is a growing collection of projects I’m building for people who wants to learn and master **JavaScript** — from beginner-friendly apps to more advanced ones.

## Project Overview

### 1. Digital Clock
A **real-time digital clock** that dynamically updates every second, showing the current time in **HH:MM:SS** format.  
It uses JavaScript’s **Date API** and **DOM manipulation** to display the time and updates automatically every second.

#### 🔹 Features:
- Displays the current time (hours, minutes, seconds)
- Automatically updates every second
- Shows time in **double-digit format** (e.g., 09:05:07)
- Fully responsive and minimal UI
- Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**

#### What you will Lear:
- Working with `Date()` object
- Using `setInterval()` for real-time updates
- Converting single digits to double digits using `padStart()`
- DOM manipulation and innerText updates
